My name is Sinework and this is my report on the first html project of this course.

My background
I have taken some courses on HTML, CSS3 and  vannila JS before. Altthough I am not proficeint in it, I have tried to taken
 Node.js and React on my own. 

Issues I faced on this project
- I took me about thirty minutes to build this project. 
- I have used sections in my html body that holds the assignments list. So, When I was validating script,
    I came up with a warning that says I should consider Adding a header for a section element. So in order to be synthactically correct,
    I have added an h3 element as a title.
- The other issue I run into was stylings. I was trying to avoid styling the page as it it is not in the scope of the assignment,
but I decided to add border radius, height and width just to make the page a bit presentable.

- I also thought about adding a style to make the footer stick to the bottom but I decided I shall do so along with the rest of the stylings later on.

Below I have attached the link to my githubpages link for the page.
